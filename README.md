# Burrito Men Showdown
A Scratch game named Burrito Men Showdown
Developed by me (datatags) as BASIC4U @ Scratch and weisboys as weisboys @ Scratch, the game creator.

We decided to put it on GitHub as well as Scratch because we could have proper collaboration, version control, branches, feedback (through issues,) and pull requests.  All that and not clutter our Scratch profiles with outdated versions of it.

As this is a Scratch project, it is covered under the [Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)

# Branches

You may be wondering what the purposes of the different branches are.
- master contains stable releases.
- beta contains testing releases.

At this point in time, there are no stable releases so master will be following the beta branch. That will change once we have a stable release.
