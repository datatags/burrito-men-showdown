Before you make a pull request, please do the following:
  - Rename the project from (whatever).sb3 to (whatever).zip
  - Extract the contents of the file into the assets folder.
  - Move the project.json file from the assets folder into the root of the repository (the directory assets is in.)
If this seems complicated, I (datatags) am developing a tool to automate most of the process.  Check it out at [scratch-with-git](https://github.com/datatags/scratch-with-git)
